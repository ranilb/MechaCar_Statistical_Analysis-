# Solution to AutosRUs’ production issue

## Introduction
AutosRUs’ is a car manufacturing company. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. Therefore, the data analytics team is going to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this work, the data analytics team do the following:

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 


## Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### About Data
The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as __vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain__, and __ground clearance__, were collected for each vehicle. The first ten rows of the data set is shown below:

### Multiple Linear regression on to predict MPG
The multiple linear regression equation was generated by considering the __mpg__ as the dependant variable and the __vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain__, and __ground clearance__ as independant variables. The results are shown below:

Therefore, the equation of the multiple linear regression is:

   mpg = 6.23*vehicle_length + 0.00125*vehicle_weight + 0.069*spoiler_angle + 3.55*ground_clearance - 3.41*AWD - 104.
   
   
__As the next step, the summary table was obtained and it is shown below:__

According to the summary statistics, __ONLY__ p-values of vehicle length, ground clearance and the intercept are smallar than even 1% significance level. Therefore, those variables are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model and hence they provide significance impact on miles per gallon (mpg) of the vehicle. Other three variables are redundant in this model.

   It can be observed that the intercept is statistically significant on the __mpg__. That means there may be some other variables and factors that contribute to the variation in __mpg__ that have not been included in our model.
   
   In addition to the p-values, the coefficient of determination (r - squared value) is 71%. Therefore, the 71% of the predictions using this model would be accurate and hence the slope of the model can not be equal to zero.
